Or, follow these steps:

2) Open a terminal and type npm install -g npm
3) If you want to create your own app:
    1. Create a new GitHub repository and open it in VS Code
    2. Open the terminal in VS Code and type npx create-next-app@latest ./
4) Or, if you are working on an existing repository, clone it to your computer using GitHub Desktop
5) To run the app, type npm run dev
    - if it doesn't work, you may have to install npm again from the VS Code terminal.
