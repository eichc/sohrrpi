## Description
Currently, finding the office hours for all of your classes at RPI is a painful process. No two professors use the same system, and so SOHR is a service that plans to fix that. 
Professors and TAs input the office hours for their classes, and students are able to look up their classes all in one place. This is a project that was started at HackRPI last
semester, so we are essentially starting from scratch. This is our first time taking RCOS and we all have limited web development experience, so this project is very beginner-friendly.

## Stack
Frontend:
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
React.js

Backend:
PHP
MySQL
Next.js

## Goals
* Determine the overall look, color scheme, UI, etc.
* Frontend for all necessary pages
* Login for students and faculty/TAs
* Form for professors to create new office hour blocks
* Allow students to save classes that they’re taking
* Calendar view of office hours
* Time, room, name of TA/mentor
* Ability to search for a specific class
* Ability to add office hour blocks as a student (needs to be approved by professor)

## Projected Milestones
<u>February</u>
* Learning React.js and Next.js
* Front-end basic design
* Start creating a pseudo design that holds the necessary information about a class

March
* Learning Next.js
* Users can log in or create an account under different categories
* Create classes and upload them to a database that all users have access to as professor/ta/mentor
* List all classes input into the database and have students be able to scroll through, visit the class-specific page, and save the course
* Save classes for each user by adding a class from the database (using static data) 
* Display classes on a homepage that were saved (only class name as a button to class-specific page)
* Display specific class information

April
* Quality of life tools
* Student submit requests to add a class office hour schedule
* Edit class settings (professor/ta only)
* Search bar (exact search with either abbreviation and number or exact class name)
* Display a weekly calendar for all classes together (or separately)
